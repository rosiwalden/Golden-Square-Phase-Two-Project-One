# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe 

## 1. Describe the Problem 

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

> As a user 
> So that I an analyse key words in my texts
> I want to see a list of uppercase words 

## 2. Design the Method Signature 

_Include the name of the method, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

'''ruby
uppercase = extract_uppercase(text)

* text is a string, containing words 'hello WORLD'
* uppercase is a list of uppercase words ['WORLD']
'''

## 3. Create Examples as Tests 

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

'''ruby
#1
extract_uppercase('hello WORLD') 
# => ['WORLD']

#2
extract_uppercase('')
# => []

#3
extract_uppercase('hello world')
# => []

#4 
extract_uppercase('HELLO WORLD')
# => ['HELLO', 'WORLD']

#5
extract_uppercase('HeLLO WoRLD')
# => []

#6
extract_uppercase('HELLO! WORLD!')
# => ['HELLO', 'WORLD']
'''

_Encode each example as a test. Youo can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement behaviour._
